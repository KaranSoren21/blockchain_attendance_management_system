# Attendance Management System on Blockchain Technologies
It is a mini-project on blockchain technology. I have built up this project with a simple web application in the attendance management system where the administrator can add attendance, names, and student IDs and view their data. When inserting students' details, the admin has to spend some money on gas on the Ropsten test network. Metamask is one of the software wallets used in this mini project.
# Smart Contracts in Solidity programming language
Smart contracts are computer programs which used to execute automatically. For executing smart contracts, we need some gas fees in the form of ether. That means ether is the currency used in the ethereum. To write these smart contracts, we need some language called Solidity.
