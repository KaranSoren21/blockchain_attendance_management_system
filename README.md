# Attendance Management System on Blockchain Technologies
It is a mini-project on blockchain technology. I have built up this project with a simple web application in the attendance management system where the administrator can add attendance, names, and student IDs and view their data. When inserting students' details, the admin has to spend some money on gas on the Ropsten test network. Metamask is one of the software wallets used in this mini project. For test purpose, I have used test ether for free of cost.
# Smart Contracts in Solidity programming language
Smart contracts are computer programs which used to execute automatically. For executing smart contracts, we need some gas fees in the form of ether. That means ether is the currency used in the ethereum. To write these smart contracts, we need some language called Solidity. 
# How to setup metamask wallet in your browser
To transact some ether, we need some wallets such as metamask wallet.
* Go `chrome extension` (possible on any browser extension) and add metamask`
* Click on `create a wallet`.
* Click on  `I agree` under `Help Us Improve Metamask`
* Then, Create a password.
* Then, note down the Secret Backup Phrase.
* Next, select each phrase in order to make sure it is correct which is already noted down. Then, click on `Confirm` 
* All done
